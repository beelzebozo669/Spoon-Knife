How NOT to Start a Recipe - Part 1 - Read the Recipe

What A Recipe Is

Before I talk about how not to start a recipe, I want to take some time to talk about what a recipe is.
According to Miriam Webster, a recipe is “a set of instructions for making something from various ingredients.”
The second definition is “a formula or procedure for doing or attaining something.”
When it comes to recipes for food, both definitions apply.  Not only is the recipe the blueprint for a particular dish, well-written recipes also teach the procedure for making something.
Many of the recipes here on The Reluctant Gourmet may seem long and drawn out, but I find it much easier to follow one if I know why I’m doing something rather than just being told to do it. I try my best not to take for granted you know the techniques necessary to complete the recipe.

Some Recipe History

The earliest known recipes were found on a tablet in Babylon and date back to around 1600 BC.
From that time forward, there have been books about cookery in many cultures throughout the world.
Many of these books focused on elaborate meals that European nobles of rival houses would have their personal chefs make, each house trying to outdo the other.

In American history, for the most part, recipes lived in cooks’ heads.
If anything was written down—a cup of milk, say—it meant a particular cup in a particular cook’s kitchen.
Procedures were passed down from mother to daughter and from cook to cook.

Even the books of the day gave rather limited directions on how to do something, and measurements were not universal.
Consider Martha Washington’s recipe for her “Great Cake,” copied here from George Washington’s Mount Vernon Estates and Garden website:

“Take 40 eggs and divide the whites from the yolks and beat them to a froth.
 Then work 4 pounds of butter to a cream and put the whites of eggs to it a Spoon full at a time till it is well work’d.
 Then put 4 pounds of sugar finely powdered to it in the same manner then put in the Yolks of eggs and 5 pounds of flour and 5 pounds of fruit.
 2 hours will bake it.
 Add to it half an ounce of mace and nutmeg half a pint of wine and some fresh brandy.
”

It was not until Fannie Farmer wrote her The Boston Cooking-School Cookbook in 1896 that measurements began to be standardized.

The modern recipe written for professional chefs is often no more elaborate than a list of measured ingredients.  These recipes rely on the chefs’ knowledge of culinary techniques and do not list procedures.

Let’s Look at How NOT to Start a Recipe

Recipes written for the home cook should have the following information:

     An introduction to the recipe, including the origin of the recipe
     Approximate time it will take to complete the recipe
     A listing of the ingredients in order of use
     Any equipment necessary to complete the recipe
     A detailed procedural section explaining the steps involved in preparing the recipe
     Temperature at which the recipe should be prepared
     For items prepared in an oven, oven temperature and time
     Number of servings

No matter how well-written a recipe is, however, it will not help you if you don’t read it.

Mistake #1  Not Reading the Recipe

So many home cooks, including me, pick up an interesting looking recipe, give it a quick scan checking out the ingredients needed, then glance at how to make it.
But, we don’t take the time to really understand what they need to do and how long it will take.
Big mistake!

Many times I have found myself in the situation where I’m halfway through a recipe and then realize I need half a cup of chopped this or I was supposed to have blanched that before the next step.
I have to stop everything I’m doing to complete the step I missed often throwing off the entire timing of the dish.

The Fix—Read, and Read Again

Read a recipe several times before you even think of lighting that stove.
Make sure you understand exactly what the author wants you to do before you get started.
Here are some things to ask yourself:

Do I have all the ingredients?
How much time will it take me to prepare this recipe?

This includes:

     All the prep time
     All active cooking time
     Any time required for marinating, whether fifteen minutes or overnight
     Any time required to plate, make a sauce, rest, etc.
     What do I need to do to prep the ingredients?
     What cooking equipment do I need?
     Do I understand all the cooking terms?
     Is the recipe written in the right order of events?
     Are there any blatant mistakes?
     And most importantly, does the recipe make sense to me?

Once you have read the recipe and have asked yourself these questions, Read It Again!

Read the recipe carefully for mistakes.
It happens.
Many of the people writing cookbooks and cooking articles in food magazines are professional cooks, not professional writers.
Unless they have very good editors with strong culinary backgrounds, there are bound to be mistakes that aren’t caught.
We all find them.

     Ingredients not listed in the recipe up front appear in the procedure
     Ingredients that are listed can’t be found in the procedure
     Ingredients aren’t listed in order of use
     Preparation instructions aren’t given early enough
     Typographical errors
     Cooking times are off
     Cooking sequence is out of order

Just because it’s written in a recipe doesn’t mean it’s correct.
Trust yourself, and don’t just assume that the recipe is correct.
If you are new to cooking and something doesn’t seem right, consult with someone with more experience in the kitchen.

Once you have established that there is an error in the recipe, you need to decide if you can infer the correct information or if the recipe is just so off that you need to find another one.
This, too, will depend on the amount of experience you have and your confidence in your abilities.

How NOT to Start a Recipe – Part 2
How NOT to Start a Recipe - Give yourself enough time - Timing & the Dreaded Meanwhile

Before You Even Think of Starting a New Recipe, Read This

Mistake #2 Not Giving Yourself Enough Time

I cannot stress this enough: just because recipes say that they can be made from start to finish in thirty or forty-five minutes does not mean that a person who is unfamiliar with the recipe or the techniques can recreate the recipe in that amount of time.
Many a time we have sat down to what was supposed to be a 7:00 pm dinner at 8:30pm because yours truly did not realistically estimate how long it would take to prepare the meal.
As much as I would like to say I am, I am not a professional chef.
Nor am I, or most of us, a television personality with a staff of behind-the-scenes people to help me out.

The Fix – Know Thyself

As you are looking over your recipe to get an idea of total work time, be very realistic about your strengths and weaknesses in the kitchen.
While some amounts of time can be taken at face value (refrigerate for 2 hours, let rest for 45 minutes, etc), others are dependent, in part, on your skill level.
If a recipe says that total prep time takes fifteen minutes and involves mincing garlic, chopping onions and tomatoes, dicing carrots and celery and measuring spices and herbs, consider how developed your knife skills are.
If your knife skills are, pardon the pun, sharp, it may only take fifteen minutes.
If you have not achieved samurai status yet, it might take you half an hour to do the prep.
If you have an entire menu planned for the week and you know that you’ll need chopped onions and tomatoes for tonight and tomorrow night’s meal, just go ahead and prep enough of them for both recipes.
That way, you’ll have some of the prep already done when you walk into the kitchen to start preparing the next evening’s meal.
You’ll feel almost like you have a prep cook.
And you do:  you were your own prep cook the day before!
Now you’re the chef, so get cookin’.

The Infamous “Meanwhile”

How many times have I gotten halfway through a recipe and come across the dreaded meanwhile.
It often refers a task that makes you hit yourself on the forehead and say, “NOW you tell me!”
     Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F
     Meanwhile, grill the vegetables
     Meanwhile, cook the pasta until al dente in a pot of boiling water
     Meanwhile, sauté 2 cups of onions
     Meanwhile, de-bone the entire chicken

Cookbook writers either assume we read their recipes carefully before we start or we are mind readers.
Did they forget that it takes time to get the grill hot or the water boiling?

The infamous Meanwhile also has some cousins that you need to be aware of.
They include The day before, The next day and Refrigerate overnight.
As you read the recipe thoroughly, make sure you recognize Meanwhile and his cousins and plan your time accordingly.

Understand the Terminology

Make sure you understand all the terminology before starting to cook.
It does you no good getting three quarters through a recipe to find out you don’t know what it means to julienne a carrot or flambé bananas.
It’s no fun to have to run to your computer to learn how to “scald” a cup of milk or “clarify” a stock.
These terms might make you “sweat” and want to “knock back” an adult beverage which really means to cook food slowly in a covered pan in a small amount of fat so the juices run into the pan and press out the air bubbles in dough that has risen before shaping and proofing.
See how confusing it can be?

Read the recipe for all of the cooking verbs:  chop, julienne, sauté, braise, and yes, sweat and knock back.
If you are unsure of how to accomplish these tasks, find out before you begin to cook.
Either look them up in the indices or glossaries of your cookbooks or find out by searching on the Internet.

Mistake #3 – Not Having All the Ingredients

If you have thoroughly read the recipe, you should have all of your ingredients on hand.
This is not a perfect world, though, and even the most detail-oriented of us sometimes forgets something.
 
If, when making a recipe, you discover that you have forgotten an ingredient, you have to decide if you can live without it (oh, no—I forgot to get 1 tomatillo for the white chili) or if it is so crucial to the recipe that you have to stop and run out to the store in the middle of what you were doing (oh, no—I’m out of flour and I’m baking bread).

The Fix—Line Them Up
It all comes back to thoroughly reading the recipe and putting your hands on every ingredient.
We’ve all done this before.
We read over the ingredient list, mentally checking our cupboards.
Italian Seasoning—check.
Bay leaves—I’m pretty sure I have some of those in the back of the cabinet.
Kosher salt—check.
Red wine vinegar—check.
Tomato paste—there’s a can on the top shelf behind the beets, I think.

This is a mistake.
Make sure you pull every ingredient and make sure that you have what you need.
You think you have tomato paste?
Find it and put it on the counter.

Gather all the ingredients that you will need and put them on the counter.
Make a list of everything else you need, shop your list, and put all the ingredients together on the counter (or in one place in the refrigerator, depending upon the ingredient).
I have even counted the number of ingredients listed in the recipe and then counted my ingredients to make sure the numbers match up.
The last thing you want to do when you’re cooking, especially if you are dealing with time and heat issues or a really involved recipe, is to run to the store.
Do yourself a favor and do a head count of your ingredients before you begin the recipe.

How NOT to Start a Recipe – Mise en Place

Mise En Place

More Mistakes Home Cooks Make When Starting a Recipe

Mistake #4 – Not Prepping Your Ingredients

Almost as important as making sure you have all your ingredients is making sure that your ingredients are cooking ready.
How many times have you started a recipe only to realize you need a chopped onion or diced carrot or minced clove of garlic and had to stop what you were doing to prep it.

Good chance something gets overcooked.
Or left out.
There’s also a good chance that you could hurt yourself while rushing around.

The Fix—Mise en Place 

Mise en place (pronounced meez ahn plahs) literally means “put in place.” 
In culinary terms, this means that you do everything possible that you can do to your ingredients, equipment and cooking space to get them recipe-ready before you start cooking.

Professional chefs prep their ingredients before starting because they don’t want to stop their workflow.
They also assemble all of their equipment, have their ovens preheated to the correct temperatures and understand the flow of the recipe well enough that they do not need to keep referring to it while trying to cook.

While mise en place is a way of life for a professional chef, it is often an alien concept to the home cook.
This is often the way we do it:
     Read a line of the recipe.
     Do what it says.
     Read another line of the recipe.
     Do what it says.

This is a very “choppy” way of cooking.  To improve your flow, start with reading the recipe thoroughly, as I described earlier.  Then, get every ingredient into the size, shape and measurement it needs to be in.
     4 oz. carrots in ¼ inch discs?  Weigh them, cut them, and put them in a bowl.
     1 medium onion, coarsely chopped?  Chop it, and put it in a bowl.
     Need ½ cup of toasted nuts?  Measure them, toast them and put them in a bowl.
     1 teaspoon kosher salt, ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, 1 ½ teaspoons dried thyme all go in at the same time?  Measure all three into one small cup or bowl.

Likewise, as you read your recipe, list all the equipment you will need and stage it all so it is ready to go.
If you’ll be whisking, get out the whisk.
If you need the stand mixer with the paddle attachment, set it up.
You get the idea.

The goal of mise en place is that, when you are ready to cook, you won’t have to stop to do anything else except cook.
We’ve all seen those cooking shows with all the ingredients in the small glass bowls, ready to be added one at a time.

You don’t need to buy special bowls – use teacups or juice glasses or even little paper cups – but you do need to take a cue from these TV chefs and prep the ingredients ahead of time.

If you’ve done your mise en place correctly and thoroughly, you will hardly have to refer to your recipe, because the cooking process will flow naturally.
It won’t be all “choppy” with having to stop in between and prep ingredients or dig out a bowl from under the cabinet.

Here are just some of the advantages of making mise en place a way of life in your kitchen.
     It lowers your stress level when preparing a recipe
     It simplifies complicated recipes and makes them more fun to prepare, since you’re not having to juggle too many techniques at once
     It guards against overcooking since you only have to concentrate on the techniques, not the preparation
     It saves time.

Mistake #5  The Unintentional Five-Course Meal

My mother tells this wonderful story that all of us can relate to.
It was her first dinner party as a newlywed, and she wanted everything to be absolutely perfect.
She planned the menu to include all sorts of tasty and elegant goodies.
She bought all the ingredients.
She knew exactly what to do, so she started preparing all of the dishes, and they all went on the stove/in the oven at the same time.

 
And then, it dawned on her.
You know what’s coming, because most of us have been there.
If she started everything cooking at the same time, some of the dishes were going to be finished well before – even an hour before – some of the other dishes.

So, she just took a deep breath and decided that, rather than trying to hold the quick cooking dishes, she’d just go ahead and serve everything as it was ready.
That meant everyone got a serving of carrots.
Just carrots.
Followed by a couple of other “courses” and ending with the meat.
Roast beef for dessert; hooray!

The Fix:  Plan, Plan and Plan Some More

While it might seem intimidating enough to make one dish, let alone an entire meal, we all face it, sooner or later.
Gather all the recipes for the dishes you’ve decided to make, and read over the instructions carefully.
Look for timing with an eye towards logistics.  Ask yourself, and be able to answer, these questions:
     How much time does it take to prep each dish?
     What are the actual cooking times?
     Do any of the dishes need to be attended while being cooked? (think sautéing versus baking or roasting)
     Are there any dishes that need to sit unattended for awhile? (like bread dough as it rises)
     Can any of the dishes be made ahead and held before cooking?
     Do any of the dishes require immediate cooking after prep? (delicate items like souffles come to mind)
     Do any of your dishes need to be served as soon as they are out of the oven/off the stove? Do some of the dishes require a rest on the counter before serving?
     Are any of the dishes best when made a day or two ahead? (chilis, any type of stew or braise, generally)
     What dishes need to be served chilled? Hot? At room temperature?

Answer these questions, and you’ll be able to devise a strategy to make sure that all your dishes are ready within ten to fifteen minutes of each other.

For example, if you’re serving a large roast, after it comes out of the oven, it will need to rest for about half an hour.
You can probably cook and mash potatoes and heat up the rolls while the meat is resting.
Keeping in mind all the other points about starting a recipe, especially the dreaded “meanwhile,” devise a timeline to help you with your prep.
Thanksgiving is a meal famous for having to keep multiple plates spinning, as it were, and there are lots of Thanksgiving dinner timelines available online that can serve as a template for other meals.
When you are planning a large family meal or dinner party, make your timeline several days ahead and take the time to read over it and become familiar with it before you launch into cooking.
It’s a good idea to make a dish or two that can be made ahead, a dish or two that need a rest after cooking as well as a dish or two that are best served immediately.
Unless you have a staff and about fourteen ovens, you don’t want to serve too many dishes that need to be whisked straight from the oven to the table.
In other words, a dinner party made up strictly of soufflés is probably not a good idea, even for a seasoned chef!
Just 1 or 2 Stellar Dishes
Give yourself a break and wow everyone with one or two stellar dishes while serving some dependable and tasty dishes as supporting players.
If you’re going to go all-out and make a beef Wellington, for example, nobody is going to talk mean about you on the way home if you serve simple steamed vegetables as a side dish.
Once you’re able to break down your meal into its component parts and have answered all the pertinent questions, you will be able to set a realistic timeline for prep and cooking and make sure that all of your dishes are ready to serve when you ring the dinner bell.
People will be amazed and impressed; all it takes is a little prior planning.
And maybe a spreadsheet!

How NOT to Start a Recipe – Kitchen Equipment

The Importance of Good Kitchen Equipment Before You Start a Recipe

Mistake #6 – Not Having the Right Equipment

As part of reading the recipe and getting your mise en place together, you should also have inventoried your cooking equipment.
While it is acceptable to make some substitutions with equipment – using a sauté pan instead of a skillet, using a wooden spoon as opposed to a silicone spatula, there are some pieces of equipment that you cannot substitute.

For example, if you are cooking a pound of pasta and don’t have a pot big enough to hold at least 6 quarts of water, you stand a good chance the pasta will not cook properly and stick together.

If you have a cheap wire whisk that you got at the flea market and the handle falls off when you start whisking, how have you saved any money?
And no, you can’t use your laundry basket as a colander.

Whether you are grilling, baking, roasting or sautéing, it is important to have the right equipment.
Yes, you can cook with cheap cookware or use inexpensive cooking tools but you won’t get the same results.

The Fix—Buying The Right Tools for the Right Job

Get yourself some good equipment.
I’m not saying that you have to go out and spend thousands of dollars, but I am saying that spending more money on good equipment once will cost you less in the long run than spending less money on cheap equipment every year or two.
Once you commit to buying the right tools for the right jobs, you have to ask yourself:
     “What kind of cook am I?”
     Will you be spending a lot of time making cakes?
     Will you be making a lot of homemade sauces?
     Do you like to make bread by hand?

What kind of cook you are will have an impact on the equipment you buy.
A stand mixer might be vital to one cook and just take up space on the counter in someone else’s kitchen.

General Cooking Equipment Essentials

Knives (see my post on cutlery)
All knife manufacturers make many, many different types of knives.
You might be tempted to buy a set with 15 knives or feel like you need to buy them one at a time for the rest of your life.
You can’t blame the manufacturers – they’re trying to make a buck, but all you really need is three good knives:  a chef knife, a paring knife and a serrated slicer.

Whole books are dedicated to knives, but suffice to say that you get what you pay for.
There are two basic types of knives – forged and stamped.
Stamped knives are very sharp when new and are relatively inexpensive.
Unfortunately, once stamped knives get dull, they are difficult, if not impossible, to sharpen.
Forged knives, on the other hand, are very sharp and more expensive, but they can – and should be – honed before every use and periodically sharpened.
Take good care of your forged knives, and they will last you a lifetime.
Always hold knives you are considering buying.
Make sure you like the balance, weight and blade angle.

Also be aware that just because you love your Global chef knife doesn’t mean that you’ll love their serrated blade.
Unless you’ve tried out the knives, don’t buy a set.
Buy what works for you.

A Non-stick Pan
You need one for omelets, frittatas and other applications when you don’t want food to stick.
This is not the place to spend big money.
Get a fairly large slope-sided skillet with a flat, heavy bottom and a smooth, non-stick finish.
Use silicone or wooden tools with this pan, exclusively, and hand wash it to avoid damaging the cooking surface.

Cutting Boards (See my post on cutting boards)
In times past, everyone used a wooden cutting board.
Wood is still an excellent material for cutting boards, but there is also a case to be made for using high-density plastic.
In either case, it is advisable to have at least two cutting boards, one for meats and one for fruits and vegetables.
Having two boards helps cut down the risk of cross-contamination.
Whichever type of cutting board you use, make sure that it is clean and that the surface is smooth.
If your plastic cutting board has lots of really deep knife cuts in it that can hold onto bacteria or even mildew, replace it.
If you’re wooden cutting board is all cut up, use a plane to smooth the surface.
Don’t use sandpaper, because the little abrasives used in the sandpaper can get embedded in the surface of your board and dull your knives.
If you have a decorative glass cutting board, use it only for decoration.
Never use a cutting board made of glass, metal, marble, granite or any other material that is so hard that it will damage your knives.
When you use a cutting board, put a damp towel underneath it to keep it from sliding.

For the Pasta Cook
Large Pot (see my post on soup pots)
You want to get a pot with a capacity of 6-8 quarts.  Make sure the bottom of the pot is flat and heavy so there is good contact between the heating element and the pot.
Since you will mostly be using this pot for wet cooking methods (namely boiling), it is not necessary to get the top of the line most expensive pot out there.
If you want to and you have the funds, more power to you, but this is not the “money pot.”
Do look for a pot that has an aluminum core sandwiched between stainless steel.
Stainless is easy to clean and non-reactive, and aluminum is a good heat conductor, ensuring that your pot will heat quickly and evenly.
Make sure that the pot has sturdy handles that can go in the oven.
This usually means metal, but there are composites out there that are oven safe to 400 degrees, so check the labels.

Colander
You will need a way to drain the water out of your pasta.
Colanders come in all shapes and sizes and are made out of everything from plastic to silicone to metal.
Purchase one that is well made, and has “feet” to keep it up out of the liquid when pouring into the sink.
Consider a stainless steel colander—it can do double duty as a steamer if you nest it into a large pot with a little water at the bottom.

For the Sauté Cook
Sauté Pan (see my post on choosing & buying a saute pan)
This is the “money pot.”  If you’re going to spend money on kitchen equipment, this is one of the first places to spend some.
A sauté pan is a large (up to 12”) pan with straight, low sides.
The pans usually have one long handle and a short handle on the opposite side for ease of lifting.
Most sauté pans come with a tight-fitting lid.
Definitely look for a heavy pan with a wide, flat bottom.
An aluminum core sandwiched between stainless steel is the way to go, generally speaking.
If you are a practiced cook, don’t mind the upkeep and have the money, buy one with a copper bottom, but since copper is more conductive than aluminum, understand that the pan will heat up very quickly and you will have no margin for error.
Make sure that the handles are sturdy and solidly attached to the pan.
Make sure that they are oven-safe, as sautés are sometimes finished in the oven.
You might also want to braise in it, and for that you’ll also need a tight-fitting lid.

For the Baker
Stand Mixer (see my post on stand mixers)
An essential piece of equipment for people who are interested in baking cakes and cookies.  Look for a heavy mixer – you don’t want it scooting all over the counter when it’s running – with at least a paddle-type and a whisk-type attachment.
If you’re into baking bread, you’ll want a dough hook as well.
Look for a mixer with a 5 to 7 quart capacity and one with all metal gearing.
Mixers made with nylon gears run more quietly, but they won’t stand up to years of heavy use like a mixer with metal gears.

General Gadgetry
Live by the rule:  if it feels cheap and looks cheap, it is cheap.
Make sure that all of your gadgets and tools – whisks, spatulas, spoons, potato mashers, peelers, garlic presses, measuring cups, etc – are sturdy and well made.
Never buy plastic tools, they melt.
When given the choice, purchase good stainless steel tools.
One notable exception is in the case of tools to be used in non-stick pans.
To keep from destroying the non-stick surface, look for tools made of or covered with high heat resistant silicone.

Other tools to have on hand
Lots of towels
Digital timers
Instant read thermometer
Probe thermometer
Bowls of various sizes
Rolling Pin
Trivet, or hot pads
Butcher’s twine
Straight sided cake pans
Cooling racks

The trick is to buy quality tools and take care of them.
If you do that, your kitchen tools will serve you well for a lifetime.

Cutlery – Choosing the Right Kitchen Knives

Kitchen Knives

Knife Basics

Before you go out and buy an expensive knife or set of knives, let’s look at a few knife basics so you know what you are talking about.
No matter what you read about a particular knife or what’s hot with the celebrity chefs, the most important feature is how the knife feels in your hand.

Most high end quality knives are going to be made well and are sure to be sharp and hold an edge, but with knives, size does matter.
If you have little hands, most likely you don’t want to be working with a 12 inch chefs knife.
Some styles are lighter than others and might be right for you but not someone with big strong hands.
So do your homework and find someplace that will let you give the knife a test drive.
This is a piece of equipment you will own for a long time and use everyday.

Knife Parts
Most knives consist of the front of the knife, tang (not the astronaut drink), bolster and handle.
Let’s look at each of these sections:

The front of a knife that contains the blade, spine, tip, and heel.
The blade is the sharp part that does the cutting.
The spine is opposite the blade and adds weight and stability.

The tip of a knife is at the point and and is used for cutting small items, making small cuts and opening packages that are impossible to break open with your hands.
The tang is that piece of metal that extends from the blade to the back of the knife and the handle attaches to.
Not all knives have tangs but most of the good ones do.
The tang also gives a knife some weight and balance or the knife would be front heavy.

The bolster is that little collar that separates the blade and the handle.
It adds strength, balance and most importantly prevents you from cutting off your finger if the knife slips when cutting.
The bolster can run from the spine to the edge or just part way.
Again, most of the better made knives have a bolster.

The handle is what you hold on to and can be made out of wood, plastic, composite or stainless steel.
You might think a handle is just a handle but since this is what you will be mostly in contact with, it’s important the handle feels good in your hand.

Construction

Knives are either blocked, forged or sintered.

Blocked knives are cut from a single sheet of metal usually of the same thickness.
The blades are ground to form the edge and handles are added to the tang.
They typically don’t have bolsters, are less expensive to make and therefore buy and are not usually very good quality.
They won’t have the balance or feel of a better made forged knife.

Forged knives is made the way we think King Arthur’s sword may have been produced.
The manufacturer takes a hunk of metal, heats it up and pounds it into the correct shape using a drop forge machine.
These knives typically have bolsters, more weight, thicker bolsters and cost a heck of lot more.
But with the extra expense, you get a better made, better balanced knife that you may have forever if take care of properly.

Sinter is a process where they take a separate blade and fuse it to a separate tang.
It’s less expensive process than forging but it allows you to create beautiful Eastern style knives like global where the blades are flat but they have tubular handles.

Eastern vs Western Style
The easiest way to describe the difference is to look at a couple of examples.
The knives in the photographs to the right are examples of Eastern styles while the Wusthof above is an example of a Western style.

Another example of Eastern (Asian) cutlery is the Chinese Cleaver that was developed for a number of cutting purposes.
It has a rectangular blade with a straight cutting edge with a slight curve for rocking purposes when mincing and dicing.
The top of the blade is dull for pounding purposes and the wide side is perfect for smashing garlic and scooping cut ingredients.

Japanese Knives
Although there are three specific specialty knives designed for cutting various ingredients in Japaneese cuisine.
The santoku knifemost knife in Japanese kitchens is called a santoku and has a long, medium width blade.
What’s interesting about this knife is it only has one sharp on one side as compared to Western style knives that are sharp on both sides.
The Japanese believe a single-edged blade cuts more effectively.

Materials – the Japanese also introduced ceramic blades to the west.
A company called Kyocera manufacturers a knife with a ceramic blade that is incredibly sharp and more durable than you would think.
Another Japanese company, Global, manufactures a stainless steel blade that can hold a razor sharp edge.
These knives are wonderfully balanced and beautiful to look at.
I’m not sure how they handle because I don’t own one yet.

How NOT To Cook With Water – Steaming

Steamed Green Beans

How NOT to Steam Foods

Steaming is arguably one of the healthiest ways to cook because no added fat is needed.
It is also a very gentle method as foods aren’t knocked around by boiling water or stirred over high heat.

Rather, the steam gently penetrates and cooks all foods at around 212ºF, the boiling point of water.
Also, water soluble nutrients are less likely to leach out of foods during steaming than in other moist heat cooking methods, such as poaching or boiling.
Unless you are serving the cooking liquid as part of the dish, as in a stew, many nutrients will be poured down the drain along with the liquid.
Almost all types of foods can be steamed including both tender and tough vegetables, dumplings, breads, cakes, meats, fish and grains.
While Americans probably think of steaming vegetables and might find it odd to steam other types of foods, people in Asian cultures have a long tradition of steaming dumplings, meats, fish and even buns.
As well, the traditional English plum pudding is a steamed cake.

Steaming can be achieved by suspending the food to be cooked above boiling liquid, making sure that the cooking vessel has a tight lid to trap the steam.
Food can also be steamed directly in cooking liquid.

While this may seem like boiling or poaching, the difference is that the steamed food – generally grains such as rice or quinoa – will absorb all the liquid, again resulting in minimal loss of nutritional value.
Another big advantage of steaming is a reduced risk of overcooking, since the cooking temperature is low.
Steamed foods are more likely to come out consistently moist than with harsher, direct heat cooking methods.
Since steamed foods cook at relatively low temperatures, they will not brown.
While you might miss the depth of flavor that the Maillard reactions bring to foods, you will notice the brightness and purity of the flavor of the food itself, which can sometimes be masked by browning.
Steaming appears to be a straightforward process, but as with many cooking methods, there are some pitfalls.
I have tried to cover all the mistakes possible, allowing you to avoid them and get perfect results every time.

You can read more about How To Steam Foods Properly here.
Most of this list of mistakes and fixes refer to vegetables, what most Americans think of when we think of steaming.

Mistake #1  Using Sub-standard ingredients
You might look in the back of your fridge and notice some broccoli that is a bit past its prime.
Not wanting to waste it, you steam it, hoping to salvage your produce.
When you serve it, your family is underwhelmed.

The Fix – Use Fresh Ingredients of the Highest Quality you can find
Steaming, perhaps more than any other cooking method, allows the flavor of the food itself to shine through.
Steaming intensifies and brightens flavors, so trying to steam an ingredient that is less than fresh is just going to enhance that quality.

The whole idea of steaming is to present a food that is true to itself with minimal flavor enhancers—spices, sauces, etc.
So, it pays to use the freshest ingredients you can find.
Fresh intensified equals tasty.
Not so fresh intensified equals yuck.

Mistake #2  Not Cutting Foods to Uniform Size
Now that you are using the freshest ingredients possible, don’t ruin them by just giving them a rough chop before putting them in the steamer.
Cutting foods into uneven pieces, with some being larger and some being smaller, will result in uneven cooking, as it takes longer for heat to penetrate larger pieces of food.
You will either end up with perfectly cooked larger pieces and mushy, overcooked smaller pieces or perfectly cooked smaller pieces with overly crunchy, under-cooked larger pieces.
Either way, this is not so great.

The Fix – Keep Foods the Same Size
I am not suggesting you get out your ruler and your scale to make sure that each piece of food has exactly the same mass and dimension, but it is very important to have your foods cut into similar sizes to ensure even cooking.
A classically trained chef might square off irregularly shaped pieces of food and then dice them precisely.

For myself, I just make sure that none of the pieces stand out as much larger than (or much smaller than) the other pieces.
This holds true for all foods, from dumplings to pieces of fish to chunks of butternut squash to cauliflower.
Consistent size leads to consistent results, so now is the time to practice your knife skills.

Mistake #3  Not Waiting for the Water to Boil
I understand that you want to get a weeknight dinner on the table in a hurry.
The temptation is to just put the ingredients in the steamer in a cold pan and then heat everything up together.
This method just equals more time in the kitchen and, quite possibly, overcooked food.

The Fix—Patience:  Wait for the Boil

If you are steaming food suspended over a liquid, as with a steamer basket or a bamboo steamer, very little liquid is needed.
After all, you are after the steam, not the liquid, and steam can take up 1600 times the volume of water.
Add to that a lidded cooking vessel which effectively traps the steam, and therefore the liquid, and it becomes obvious that you don’t need much liquid to start with.
A couple of ounces is quite probably sufficient to effectively steam most foods, and such a small volume will take very little time to come to a boil anyway.
If you start with your foods in the cold pan, they will begin to cook as the water heats, even before it comes to a boil.
You will end up with foods that can be mushy and overcooked on the surface, even if the interior of the food is cooked to perfection.

Mistake #4 Overcrowding the Pan
Now you have your foods cut all in uniform pieces, but you will still encounter problems if you pile too much food into the steamer – you will end up with some pieces that are under – or over-cooked, just as if you hadn’t taken the time to cut the food uniformly in the first place!
What gives?

The Fix—Give the Food Some Space
When you boil foods, even if all the pieces aren’t necessarily the same size, the water is turbulent because of the rapid bubbling, and the heat is able to penetrate all the pieces of food.
Steaming is much less dense than water  – consider that the same mass of steam takes up 1600 times more space than an equal mass of water – and cooks very gently.
There are no bubbles to agitate the food and stir it around.
You’re not stirring the food with a spoon, either, because the cooking pot needs to stay lidded.
The steam gently cooks the foods it can “get to.”
If you have piled a bunch of food into your steamer basket, the steam is not going to move the pieces around to get down to the ones in the center of the pile, so make sure your food is not crowded.
Place the food in a shallow layer in the steamer, not in a pile.
If you have a bamboo steamer with stack-able inserts, split up large amounts of food in two or even three baskets so the steam is able to penetrate it all the food evenly.

How NOT to Steam Foods – Part 2

Steamed Dumplings

More Steaming Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

This is Part 2 of How NOT to Steam Foods.

Mistake #5  Covering the Pan Loosely
If you think that you are steaming in a vessel without a lid, or just loosely covered with a piece of parchment, you are sadly mistaken.
Steam travels in one direction:  away from the heat source.
This means that, while the food closest to the liquid might get cooked even without a lid, the top surface of the food will remain cold and uncooked.

The Fix—Use a Tight-Fitting Lid
I might be dating myself, but do you remember the old Atari game Pong?
The little rectangular “ball” traveled in a straight line until it ricocheted off of the edge of your TV screen.
Think of steam as a bunch of little Atari Pong balls moving in straight lines.
They will continue to move in those straight lines, away from the heat source, unless they hit the edge of the TV screen, or in this case, the lid.
Keeping the steam enclosed ensures convection – the hottest steam, the steam closest to the heat source, rises to the lid, cools somewhat as it comes in contact with the metal and then sinks, only to be reheated as it again gets close to the heat source.
This rising and falling ensures that the food will be cooked from all sides, including the top.
The tighter-fitting the lid, the more steam is trapped and the more quickly and evenly your food will cook.
Of course, there will always be some loss of steam, unless you are using a pressure cooker.
You just want to minimize the amount of steam that escapes by using a pan with a tight-fitting lid.

Mistake #6  Overcooking
The difference between crisp tender steamed vegetables and mushy ones might only be a matter of a minute or two, and if you wanted mushy vegetables, you probably wouldn’t be steaming in the first place.
The Fix – Check Your Foods.  Also, See Mistakes 2, 3 and 4
If you cut your foods in uniform size, make sure the water is boiling before you add the food and allow adequate space for the steam to penetrate, you will be going a long way towards minimizing the chance of overcooking.
Most recipes you will find for steaming will give a specific amount of time until the food is done, but unless you’ve cut your foods exactly the same size as the recipe and the liquid comes back to a boil in exactly the same amount of time as it did in the test kitchen and you like your foods done exactly the way the recipe author likes theirs done, consider the amount of time a guideline.
Quickly check your food a couple of minutes before the time specified in the recipe, and if it is not done to your liking, put the lid back on quickly to minimize the loss of steam.

Mistake #7  Peeking
While you do want to check your food for doneness after a few minutes, you gain nothing by continually lifting the lid and checking to see what’s happening in that pan.
By peeking, you are losing moisture, and chances are you will have to add more liquid at some point during the cooking process.
If you add cold liquid, you are just increasing the cooking time and also increasing the risk of over-cooking.

The Fix – No Peeking!
You just have to trust that steam plus convection will cook your food with no outside assistance from you, so leave that lid closed.
If you really, really must see what’s going on, buy a pot with a glass lid, so you can see without lifting the lid.

Mistake #8 Overcooking, Part 2
As you may already know, carryover cooking is the cooking that takes place once the food has been removed from the heat source.
Heat is energy, and that energy will continue to radiate through the food from the surface to the center until it the temperature falls enough.
In some cases, as in roasting large pieces of meat or poultry, we allow for carryover cooking by removing the food from the oven when the temperature is still a few degrees below the target temperature.
The temperature continues to rise while the meat is resting.
Since foods to be steamed are usually cut in small pieces, there is not a lot of mass to absorb all the carryover heat, so foods can overcook very quickly.

The Fix – The Shock
If you are planning on serving your steamed foods hot, make sure that you that steaming is the last thing you do before serving.
Minimizing the wait time between cooking and serving reduces the amount of carryover cooking.
If you are planning on serving your steamed vegetables cold, you will want to shock them, or rapidly stop the cooking process, by immersing them in a bowl of ice water directly after cooking.
The heat in the vegetables rapidly dissipates into the ice water, allowing your foods to be served perfectly cooked, even hours later.
If you need to steam well before service time and still plan to serve the steamed foods hot, steam them until just under-done, shock them, and then reheat them right before serving.

Mistake #9  Not Enough Time
Sometimes on a weeknight, you just want a cooking technique that is very easy, only dirties one pot and doesn’t take too long.
For these reasons, you might choose steaming.
Even on the busiest evening, between getting home from work, ferrying kids to classes, clubs or team practice and homework, a nice steamed, one dish meal is only a few minutes away.

The Fix – Don’t Forget the Microwave
Place bite-sized pieces of fish in a microwave safe baking dish.
Add tender vegetables such as sugar snap peas, mushrooms, green beans, broccoli and cauliflower florets.
Season with salt and pepper, drizzle with a bit of olive oil or a couple of small pieces of butter.
Add 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable or chicken broth.
Cover with plastic wrap with one corner turned back.
Steam on high for six minutes, stirring and rearranging the fish every two minutes so it cooks evenly.
Serve with a squirt of fresh lemon juice and a sprinkling of fresh herbs.
This is just one example of an easy, healthy, one-dish microwave meal; use this technique and vary the vegetables, protein and seasonings to come up with almost limitless possibilities.
Now, you have a healthy alternative to the lure of weeknight fast food.

Mistake #10 (referring to starchy grains such as rice)  Not Rinsing Before Steaming
Rice and other grains can be steamed directly in liquid, generally at a ratio of 1 cup grain (rice, amaranth, quinoa, barley, etc) to 2 cups of liquid.
Cooking whole grains is pretty straightforward.
Bring the liquid and the grains up to a boil, stir a couple of times, put on a tight-fitting lid and turn down the heat to low.
Most grains will completely absorb the liquid within 20-30 minutes.
Brown rice and other grains with a tough bran layer can take up to 50 minutes to completely absorb the liquid.
Regardless of how easy it can be to steam grains, I’m sure we have all had the experience of ending up with rice that is all sticky and clumped together.
Fortunately, there’s an easy fix for this one.

The Fix—Rinse your grains first
The best way to achieve light, fluffy, separate grains is to rinse them first.
Rice in particular is very starchy, and when the grains begin to swell up and the starches start to gelatinize, they can often stick together.
Rinse the grains in several changes of cold water, until the water no longer looks milky.
Then, add your cooking liquid, bring to a boil, cover and steam over low heat until all the liquid is absorbed.

How NOT to Season Food With Salt

A Grain of Salt

Common Mistakes When Seasoning With Salt
Salt is critical for bringing out flavors in the foods we cook.
One of my problems with eating out, especially at good restaurants, I find chefs often over salt their dishes.
I’m not sure why and this would be a great topic for another article but I find it happens often.
How about you?
What are your experiences when dining out?

Regarding Salt
Salt functions as an electrolyte in the body and plays an absolutely vital role in cell function.
Salt is essential:  no salt equals death.
While not using enough salt in our cooking thankfully won’t kill us, salt is absolutely the most important and universally applicable spice there is.
Technically, salt is not a spice, it is a mineral.
Salt is the only rock that we eat.
And not just people – all animals are drawn to salt.
There must be something hard-wired into us that seeks out salt because of the vital role it plays in our chemistry.
And, just as poisons are bitter to reduce the likelihood of accidental ingestion, salt is tasty, and we seek it out.
Coincidentally – or most likely not coincidentally – bitter and salty are two of the main flavors that we can taste.
We recognize bitterness so we can stay away from it.
We recognize salty so we can eat more of it.
Pass the chips, please.
One of the most common mistakes that novice cooks make is not using enough salt.
I know that can be a dangerous thing to say in this day and age where there is such a push for low-sodium options, but the problem is that salt, and a ton of it, can be found in almost all processed foods.
If you don’t believe me, check the labels and the sodium content.
By staying away from processed foods and by using salt appropriately, we can all enjoy great tasting foods without blowing our sodium intake.
Remember, if you make a cake and add one teaspoon of salt to the batter, that might sound like a lot, but you’ll be cutting that cake into sixteen to twenty pieces, so each piece will only contain 1/20-1/16th teaspoon of salt.
That’s roughly 120-150mg of added sodium per slice, keeping in mind that some of the ingredients contain sodium naturally.
Compare that to 1170mg sodium in 100g of corn flakes, 520mg in a McDonalds hamburger or 2456.2 mg in Outback’s dressed baked potato!*
While I am not a nutritionist, it is hard to argue with numbers like that.
Stay away from processed foods, only splurge occasionally at restaurants and cook for yourself and your family.
This seems to be a reasonable recipe for lowering sodium intake.


When to Use Salt
Use a judicious amount of salt in all of your cooking.
This includes everything from soups to stews to salads to desserts.
Using salt wisely allows the flavors of your foods to shine.
Salt brings a depth of flavor to everything you make, and it’s a depth that you cannot get by using salt substitutes or no-salt blends.
If you do have a serious health issue and your doctor has told you to severely curtail your salt intake, you can achieve similar seasoning results with citric acid (lemon or lime juice) and/or vinegar, but a no salt herb blend will just leave you with muddy flavors.

When to Add Salt
In using salt, season as you go should be your mantra.
Add a pinch of salt along with every layer you add to your dish.
For example, if you are making a stew, lightly season your meat before browning.
Then, add a bit of salt along with any onions/celery/carrots, etc that you cook.
If you add tomatoes, add a pinch more salt.
Add a tiny bit of salt each time you add another ingredient/combination of ingredients and your food will be well-seasoned but will not taste salty.
If you wait to add salt at the end of cooking, your dish will just taste salty.
Right before serving, taste what you’ve made one more time – you have been tasting all along, right? – and add a bit more salt if necessary.
*Nutrition information from:  Healthy Eating Club, McDonalds and Outback

What If I Add Too Much Salt?
If you season and taste as you go, this should not be a problem.
I should note that if you will be adding a canned or boxed broth or stock to your dish or if you are going to reduce (cook down) a salted liquid, have a very light touch with the salt and make sure to taste your food after you have reduced it.
Reducing a liquid has the effect of increasing the salt concentration in your liquid, so tread lightly here.
If you do end up with a dish that is too salty, there are a couple of things you can do to help fix it.
If possible, add some water, wine or other non-salty liquid to help decrease the salt concentration.
If you’re making a stew or a soup, add in a couple of cut up potatoes and let simmer.
Through osmosis, some of the salt will end up in the potato and not in your soup.
Then, remove the potato, and you should be good to go.
Once, I had to rescue overly-salted mashed potatoes.
I removed some of the salty mash and set it aside.
Then, I cooked a couple more potatoes in unsalted water, mashed them and then added them to the original dish.
Dish: rescued!
Another way in which you can inadvertently add too much salt to a dish is when you try and substitute table salt for kosher salt.
Table salt, what many people still use for seasoning during cooking, is made of very fine grains and it packs down pretty tightly.
Kosher salt has larger, flakier crystals and does not pack down.
As a result, one teaspoon of table salt contains more salt by weight than does one teaspoon of kosher salt.
If the recipe specifically calls for kosher salt, use kosher salt.
If you don’t have kosher salt, start with 1/2 the amount called for of table salt and then season to taste from there.

How Can I Tell If I’ve Added Enough Salt without Adding Too Much?
Seasoning is something that you’ll get better at the more you do it.
I once heard of a chef that made his new kitchen hires do this:  start with a cup of unsalted chicken stock, and add one grain – literally – of salt at a time, noting the differences in the flavor with each addition.

While I don’t necessarily recommend doing that, it is not bad practice to start with a bland dish, which I define as anything that doesn’t contain salt, and add a little salt at a time, tasting as you go.
In this way, you’ll know what an under-seasoned dish tastes like.
You’ll also know what a well-seasoned dish tastes like.
You will notice that the salt brings out all the dimensions in the dish and can take a bland dish and elevate it to something heavenly.
Hopefully, you will only have to taste an over-seasoned dish once!

What About All Those Pink and Gray Salts Out There?
While all salt mostly contains sodium chloride, some contain varying degrees of other minerals or even organic compounds that lend color and subtle (and not-so-subtle) flavor to the salt.
Generally speaking, save uniquely colored and flavored specialty salt for finishing and use a more purely salty salt, like kosher and sea salt, for cooking.

Specialty salts are also usually coarser than cooking salts, and chefs have learned to use the large crystals for their shine and sparkle as well as for a crunchy flavor accent and a nice hit of color to the plate.

How NOT to Season Foods

How NOT to Season Foods – Common Seasoning Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

Spices and seasonings are our passport to a whole world of flavor possibilities.
We are very lucky that we live in a time when a host of spices are readily available for our use and experimentation.
In the past, wars have been fought over spices.
Great voyages were funded by royalty to find ways to get to the spice-rich countries of South and Southeast Asia (The “East Indies”).
Why do you think Columbus was bumbling around in the Atlantic Ocean?
He was trying to find the Western Route to the “East Indies,” and happened to run into this big old country instead.  But that’s another story.
The point is that spices have always been important.
The word salary comes from the Latin word for salt, and while the relationship between salt and pay is unclear today, it is true that salt was precious to the Romans.
Somewhere along the line, American house wives’ pantry supply of spices dwindled down to some salt, pepper and maybe some seasoned salt.
Since the rekindling of America’s love affair with all things culinary, started by Julia Child back in the 60’s, more and more herbs have begun making an appearance in pantries across the country.
This is an exciting state of affairs, and I have slowly begun experimenting with different herbs, spices and seasoning blends.
It can be a little intimidating at first.  After all, there are so many spices available, and it can be daunting to find the right ones or combinations of spices to give the flavor profile we’re after.
Part of the problem is that spices can be expensive.
As home cooks, we are also somewhat limited by space and occasions to use spices.


For example, it seems a bit silly to buy spices in bulk to save some money if we’ll ever only use a fraction of them.  And, if we do buy in bulk, where do we store all that stuff?
So, what’s a home cook to do?  This chapter is a good place to start.
We’ll look at the difference between herbs and spices, the right way – and for how long – to store them, the ones to look for and how to use them. But first, let’s look at the difference between herbs and spices.
In a nutshell, herbs come from the leafy parts of plants while spices come from everything else:  roots, bark, seeds, fruits, etc. 
In general, herbs are green and can be purchased fresh or dried.  Spices, again in general, can be almost any other color except green and leafy:  brown, yellow, red, russet.  Spices can be purchased whole or ground.
That seems like a pretty simplistic definition, but it is a true definition.  Besides, isn’t nice to have something about cooking be simple for a change?!
These next few chapters will look at some of the more common mistakes home cooks make when it comes to spices and at the end I’ll offer you a table of spices, their flavor profile, associated cuisines, used in sweet or savory dishes and what they go well with.

Mistake #1 Storing Herbs and Spices Improperly
Most of us have fallen for the siren song of the beautiful spice rack display.
They are very popular wedding shower gifts, so it seems as though we all know that herbs and spices are necessary even if we don’t know how to take care of them.
As a result of having your spices and herbs proudly displayed on your countertop, most of them fade and lose potency very quickly due to exposure to light.

The Fix–Store in a Cool, Dry Place
That sounds like the instructions on most of our vitamins and medicines, doesn’t it?
Well, historically, many spices and herbs have been used for medicinal purposes, so it stands to reason.
The advice is sound.
Light and heat break down the essential and volatile oils that give dried herbs and spices their characteristic flavors.
Store your spices away from your oven and stove–just a cabinet away will do and keep them in airtight, lightproof containers.
If you don’t want to repackage all of your spices and herbs that you bought in glass bottles, just keep them in a dark place.
When you need to use them, take them out, get what you need, and then put the rest away.

How NOT to Season Food – Part 2

Selection of Herbs and Spices

More Common Mistakes When It Comes to Herbs & Spices

Mistake #2  Keeping Herbs and Spices Forever

Most of us have a dark, dusty corner of our spice cabinet where old spices go to die.  You know the place.  It’s where you keep the rarified spices that you bought to make a special dish for your first wedding anniversary.


You bought 4 ounces of spice, you used 1/2 teaspoon, and then you put the jar away, never to see the light of day again.  Eventually, you gathered quite a collection of one-time used spices that all huddle together, forgotten.

The Fix: Take Inventory; Buy Only What You Need; Replace as Necessary

Your spice cabinet is your doorway to world cuisine.  It’s the path to vibrant and tasty foods.  Know what you have.

If you do need a special spice for something, do some research and find out what other uses there are for it.  Taste your spices when you get them, and plan to use them in as many ways as you can.

If you don’t consider yourself a very adventurous cook yet, buy the smallest amount possible of a spice or herb that you need for a special dish.  If you truly cannot find any other uses for your purchase, give it to a foodie buddy so that it won’t languish in the Spice Graveyard.

Dried herbs can be kept for no more than about six months, so you should never buy more than what you can use in that period of time.  Before using a dried herb, pour the required amount in your palm and then crush it with the thumb of your other hand.  This will help to release the volatile oils and bring out the flavor in the herb.

If you always make sure to do this step, you might be able to squeeze nine months out of dried herbs, but don’t push your luck. If your herbs smell old and faint, they aren’t going to perform well in your dish.

Depending on the spice, dried spices can last from six months to a year.  Some spices have better keeping qualities when refrigerated.  Make sure that they are well-sealed so no moisture will seep in, and again, use in a timely manner.

There is no use in buying a huge vat of spice at the warehouse store if you’re only going to use a tablespoon every once in awhile.  Spices are fairly expensive, so a “bargain” price is really no bargain at all unless you’re going to use it up.

Whole spices, such as nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cumin, cinnamon and cardamom, last much longer than their ground counterparts.  Whenever possible, opt for the whole spice and grind it yourself as you need it.

Depending upon the spice, whole spices will last for two or more years, giving you

a) more time to use them up without their losing flavo.

b) more time to learn different ways to use them so you won’t have to give them away to your foodie buddy!

In the case of fresh herbs, moisture is definitely the enemy.  When you bring home fresh herbs, rinse them well and then dry them by rolling them loosely in paper towels.  You can then store the herbs in the refrigerator loosely rolled in another paper towel or upright in a jar or small vase with about an inch of water in it.

That’s right – treat them like cut flowers.  After all, they are cut plants.  Make sure that no leaves are submerged in the water, and change the water daily.

When the herbs start looking a bit wilted and are turning yellow, it is a sure sign that they are past their prime, so make sure to use fresh herbs within a week or so of purchasing/harvesting.

Fresh Herbs Dry Herbs Convertions

Mistake #3  Making Random Substitutions Between Fresh and Dried Herbs and Spices

Many fresh herbs and spices taste much different than their dried counterparts.  It is not such a huge issue with spices, as most are widely used in their dried form.

Most herbs, however, can be found dried or fresh.  Knowing which form of the herb to use, and when, can make a huge difference in the flavor of your dish.

The Fix:  Know Thy Herbs

Fresh herbs, unsurprisingly, have a fresh “green” taste as part of their flavor profile.  When dried, this green taste fades.

Further, since the moisture has all been driven out of the leaves, what is left are the volatile essential oils that lend both their aroma and flavor to the herbs.  As a result, the flavors are much more concentrated.

Of course, not all herbs have the same concentration of essential oils, so when dried, their flavor is quite muted.

For example, it is not generally a good idea to use basil or mint in their dried forms because the intense flavors are found more in the water-based moisture in the leaves rather than in oil.  When the water evaporates during the drying process, so does much of the flavor.

When using fresh herbs, it is generally best to add them towards the end of the cooking process (or to use them as garnish after cooking) to take full advantage of the “green,” grassy notes.

Use dried herbs towards the beginning of the cooking process to give the leaves plenty of time to re-hydrate and to let the concentrated essential oils disperse throughout the dish.

As far as substituting one form for the other, just know that the flavor profile will be different when subbing fresh for dried, or vice versa.  Not that one is better than the other, of course – the flavor of the dish will just be different.

Given that, the prevailing ratio of substitution is one to three.  That means that you will need three measures of fresh herbs to equal one measure of dried.

Conversely, for each measure of fresh herb, you’ll need 1/3 that amount of dried.  Remember to add the dried herbs towards the beginning of cooking and the fresh right at the end or at the time you’re serving.

Of course, to complicate matters, there are exceptions to the rule.  Woody-stemmed, resinous fresh herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, bay and sage can be added at the beginning of cooking as their flavor comes mainly from oils instead of water-based moisture.  These herbs can stand up to long cooking as their flavor won’t literally go up in steam.

Another issue in fresh herb usage is in the way you prepare the herbs for cooking.  A rough chop will lend a milder overall flavor than a mince since there is much less cell damage to the leaves.

As a rule, the more assertive the flavor of the herb, the less processing you’ll want to do before adding it to the dish.

Rosemary is a very strong-flavored herb, so using it in judicious amounts and in its whole form (whole leaves or small even sprigs) will keep its flavor from overpowering your dish.  If, however, you want an intense rosemary flavor – maybe for an infused oil – mincing the leaves will release many more essential oils, resulting in a very bold flavor.

Mistake #3  Muddy Flavors

Just because you own a whole cabinet full of spices does not mean you should use all of them in every dish you make.

When you get overzealous in the application of herbs and spices, the very characteristics that make them so tasty in ones, twos or threes can turn into a jumbled mess if you get carried away.  No one flavor is allowed to shine, and then all the flavors suffer because of it.

The Fix–Use Complementary Flavors

This is one of the phases that you sometimes have to go through on the road to becoming a good and confident cook.  But, as in decorating and art, sometimes less is more.

There are certain flavors that go well together:  parsley and lemon, rosemary and thyme, cinnamon and nutmeg, coriander and cilantro.

There are also classic pairings of foods and spices:  lamb and mint or rosemary, tomatoes and basil, cream and nutmeg, poultry and sage.  If you stick to these combinations, you really can’t go wrong.

This doesn’t mean, however, that these pairings are set in stone.  Do some research about the dish you’re making and then try adding another herb/spice or two to the mix.  Just let one be the dominant flavor and let the others play a supporting role.

I know you might not want to get out another measuring spoon, but using one teaspoon of an herb/spice and 1/4 teaspoon of a couple of supporting flavors will give you a much more focused dish than if you had used 1 teaspoon of everything.

Do not think that it is cheating to use a ready-made spice or herb blend.  This is almost a foolproof way of balancing the amounts of spice and herb that you add to a dish.  I always have curry powders, chili powders and herbal blends such as Italian seasoning or Herbes de Provence on hand to add to dishes or to use as a flavor base.

Study the ingredient lists of these blends; use the Internet to search for a substitute for a particular seasoning blend or to find out what herbs and spices are generally associated with what cuisines.  In this way, you will become familiar with the cuisines of different cultures and will be able to evoke those flavors by using certain herbs and spices and not others.

For example, while it makes perfect sense to use cilantro in a Mexican or Indian dish, you wouldn’t use it in a French dish–cilantro is not a part of the palette of flavors available in France.

Above all remember this:  spices and herbs should enhance the flavor of the main ingredient, not hide it.

While it might be true that strong spices were used years ago to mask off-flavors in foods before the age of refrigeration, these days, spices should generally take the role of flavor enhancer, not flavor masker.

How NOT to Saute – Part 1
G. Stephen Jones • June 13, 2018 • 2 Comments
Finding the right culinary school

Learn How NOT to Saute, Common Saute Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

If I asked you to tell me the mental picture you have of a chef, chances are good that you aren’t going to describe a guy grilling burgers, putting a roast in the oven or drizzling truffle oil artfully on a finished dish.

No, your idea of chef is likely to be one of a guy standing in front of a huge gas range with pans on each burner, tossing the ingredients in one pan after another.

The image is most often of someone sautéing food.  And why is this?

The sauté method is one of the most hands-on of the dry heat cooking methods.  You can’t really walk away from a sauté the way you can a braise or a roast.  You have to be right there, adjusting the cooking temperature, keeping small ingredients moving, and tossing to ensure even cooking.

Sauté comes from the French verb “to jump.”  This describes both the tendency of small pieces of food to “jump” a little in sizzling hot oil.

It also describes that quintessential chef maneuver of jumping* the food in the pan to promote even cooking.  You’ve seen it.  You may have even tried it, although, take it from me:  it takes some practice to master “the jump” without making a huge mess in the kitchen!

Sautéing is a great cooking method for thin or small cuts of meat as well as diced vegetables.  Since sautéing is done over relatively high heat, it is important to make sure that the ingredients to be cooked are small enough that their outsides don’t burn before the insides are cooked.


Report this ad
 
Like any other cooking technique, there is a right way to sauté and a wrong way to sauté.  Many home cooks are actually steaming their food when they think they are sautéing, so it’s time to take a look at the sauté technique and learn exactly how to do it so you will get the results you want.

Mistake #1  Not using the right type of pan

If you don’t have the right kind of pan for sautéing, you can very easily end up with burnt food.  Have you ever tried to “jump” food in a straight-sided pan?  It doesn’t work so well.

Since sautéing is a quick, high heat cooking method that requires a lot of attention, it is best to set ourselves up for success, rather than to come away discouraged after trying our hands at it.

The Fix – Use the Right Pan

The proper pan to use for a sauté is a small to medium pan with low, sloped sides.  Most of us know this as a “frying pan.”

What can be confusing is that there is a pan called a “sauté pan” that has straight sides.  Sometimes, kitchen language is confusing.  That is the best explanation I have for you.

You will want a “frying pan” that has a heavy, flat bottom and is not non-stick.  The former is to promote even heating and to minimize the chance of “hot spots” in the pan.

The former, you might find to be a little counter intuitive, but there are two reasons for it.  The first is that we often build a pan sauce using the browned bits (fond) on the bottom of the sauté pan.  If the pan is nonstick, it will not have as much fond built up, and our sauce will not be as good.

Second is for health reasons.  It has been shown that Teflon breaks down and emits poisonous gases at high temperatures.  Since sautéing is a high heat cooking method, it’s best not to tempt fate and only use our nonstick pans for omelets and scrambled eggs, both of which are cooked over lower heat.

 

Mistake #2  Putting Food in a Cold Pan

When I first started cooking, I can’t tell you how many times I ended up with foods hopelessly stuck to—and sometimes burned onto–my pans.  I couldn’t understand why it happened so frequently.

How can a nice, smooth surface grab onto and hold food that way?  It turns out, I had been violating one of the Commandments of Cooking:  Thou Shalt Not Cook in a Cold Pan.

If you were to look at a smooth metal pan under high magnification, you would see that the surface is covered with microscopic scratches and nicks.  These microscopic scratches provide plenty of surface area for food to stick to.

Now, consider that many of the foods that we sauté are proteins (meat and fish) and that glue is made of proteins, and it becomes obvious that putting food into a cold pan and heating them together provides ample opportunity for some of the proteins to sink down into those microscopic scratches and then set and stick there.

The Fix – Preheat the Pan

Always preheat your pan.  When a pan heats up, the metal expands, and the vast majority of those microscopic scratches and nicks “fill in,” providing you with a much smoother surface than you had when the pan was cold.

Then, when you add food to a hot pan, the proteins immediately start to cook and form a crust.  Once the crust is set, foods release from the pan.  Once I learned this one simple technique, that was the end of my struggle with foods sticking in the bottoms of my pans. 

So, how do you know when your pan is hot enough?  The easiest test is to add a few drops of water to the pan.  If it evaporates immediately, you know that the temperature of the pan is at least 212° F (the boiling point of water).

Proteins start to brown at about 330° F, and that’s how hot you want your pan.  If the water evaporates immediately, it’s a safe bet that your pan is hot enough.

If the water sits there for a few seconds before boiling away, heat for another minute or so, and then test again. With my pans on my stove, I’ve learned that a pre-heat of 4 minutes is perfect, and I actually set the times.

 

Mistake #4  Putting Oil in a Cold Pan

It is very frustrating to preheat your pan, only to have your oil smoke and burn before the pan is hot enough.  It is important that the oil be hot, but how can you get it hot enough without burning it?

The Fix – Add Oil to a Preheated Pan

Sautéing is all about controlling the cooking process while trying to maintain the highest temperature possible.  We already know that we need to add the food to a hot pan.  In order to keep the fat from burning, wait until the pan is hot before adding the oil.

There are a couple of reasons for this.  The first is a safety issue.  Sprinkling water into a hot pan containing oil is just asking for trouble.  The oil will spatter, and you could receive a serious burn.  To minimize your chances of getting hurt, add the oil after you’ve tested the temperature of the pan.

Another reason to add oil to a hot pan is that it will take less time to heat up.  Less time heating means less chance of burning.

So, the rule is:  Get your pan hot, test to make sure it’s hot enough, and then add the oil and let it heat up.  You will know that your oil is hot enough when it starts to shimmer in the pan.  Add the food once you see the oil shimmering as the shimmer is the precursor to smoking.

 

Mistake #5  Using The Wrong Fat

You should sauté in a hot pan, one that is at least 330° F to promote quick and even browning.  This is wonderful, but many fats start to smoke and break down well before this temperature is reached.

Here is a very short list of some common fats that most of us have in our kitchens and their smoke points:

Extra virgin olive oil = 320° F

Butter = 350° F

Vegetable shortening = 360° F

Refined canola oil = 400° F

Peanut oil = 440° F

The Fix, Part 1 – Use Fats With High Smoke Points

After looking at the list of fats and their smoke points, it becomes obvious pretty quickly that, since the smoke point is lower than the temperature that proteins start to brown, extra virgin olive oil is not really the best choice for sautéing.

Choose an oil with a smoke point of at least 400 degrees.  Smoking oil indicates that the oil is actually breaking down and may be forming compounds that are toxic, or at the very least, compounds that lend off-flavors to food.  Canola and peanut oils are safe bets for sautéing.

Butter provides excellent flavor, but the milk solids in butter burn well before the smoke point of butterfat, so it is not advisable to sauté in straight butter, unless you are using clarified butter.

The Fix, Part 2 – Use a Mixture of Fats

An ideal way to add the rich flavor of butter while making sure that it doesn’t burn is to use a mixture of half butter and half oil.  Once the pan is hot, simply add a small amount of oil, and then add a little butter right on top of the oil.  Swirl the two together until the butter has melted and the oil is hot, and then add the food to be sautéed.

 

Mistake #6 Using Too Much Fat

I know you might feel like a chef as you liberally add fat to your frying pan for a sauté.  The thing is, though, that too much oil will produce completely different results than using just a bit of fat.

If you add more fat than is necessary to just coat the bottom of your pan, the oil will have depth.  That means that, rather than sitting on a thin layer of fat coating the pan, the food will be sitting in hot fat.  So now, instead of sautéing, you are really pan frying.

The Fix – Use Just Enough Fat

I think that one of the reasons home cooks often end up adding too much fat to their pans for a sauté is that they usually add the fat to a cold pan.  And cold fat is more viscous than hot fat, so it won’t spread out in as thin a layer as hot fat will.

Remember the sequence:  heat the pan; then add the oil.  Heat the oil; then add the food.  You will most likely find that you need no more than a tablespoon or so of fat.

Swirl the hot pan around, and the fat should easily spread out to coat the pan with no problem.  The fat will help to conduct the heat to the food.  So, in the case of a sauté, the fat is a cooking medium more than it is an ingredient.

 

*You might be wondering, “When do I get to jump the food in the pan?”  For presentation-sized cuts of meat, you don’t.  You can jump your food when you’re sautéing your vegetables.  I strongly suggest you practice outside with dried beans in a cold pan before you try jumping 350 degree F. onions over a hot stove!

How NOT to Saute – Part 2
G. Stephen Jones • June 21, 2018 • 0 Comments
How to Saute

This is Part 2 of How NOT to Saute. You can read Part 1 here.

Mistake #7  Not having the ingredients prepped ahead of time.

One of the worst things you can do when you prepare to sauté is to wait to chop your ingredients before you heat your pan.  Thinking that you have plenty of time to dice some onion, carrot and celery while the pan is heating is a good way to overheat the pan so that the fat immediately degrades and smokes when you add it to the pan.  When that happens, you just have to start all over again.

The Fix—Mise en Place (Prep ahead)

Mise en place is the rule by which all professional chefs live by.  It is also very relevant in the home kitchen.  Literally meaning “put in place,” mise en place means getting all of your ingredients measured, prepped and ready to cook as well as getting ovens preheated and all of your necessary equipment out before you start cooking.

When you sauté, you have to be especially mindful of mise en place.  Since you need to keep your eyes and ears on the food at all times, you don’t have time to stop to mince some garlic or peel and chop a carrot during the process.  The sauté procedure should be:

1 – Prep all ingredients:  chop, mince, measure, portion—whatever needs to be done.

2 – Heat pan.

3 – Add fat and heat.

4 – Cook.

If you don’t follow this sequence, you run the risk of forgetting important ingredients, burning your food, or both.

Mistake #8  Trying to Cook at One Temperature

Once you have heated your fat over medium-high to high heat, you add your food.  You hear a happy sizzle, which soon turns to an angry sputtering.  Then, the fat begins to smoke and your food starts to burn.

The Fix—Use Your Ears

The sauté is an active cooking method.  Unlike a braise which you can leave in the oven unattended for hours, you always have to be right with your sauté.

While it is very important to get your pan hot before adding fat and then ingredients, it is also important to know that you must always be ready to adjust the heat, either up or down.  In this sense, sautéing is like driving.

Just as you need to sometimes apply the gas, sometimes apply the brakes or sometimes just coast to maintain a constant speed in a car, you have to adjust the heat either up or down when you sauté.

You might even need to take the pan off the heat altogether at some points and let some of the residual heat in the pan continue to cook the food. The question then becomes, “How do you know when to adjust the heat?”

This is where your ears come into play.  When a food is sautéing, there should be a definite sizzling sound.

When the fat or food cooks at too high a temperature, the sizzle will become much louder and sound more like sputtering and cracking.  This is a signal to take the food off the heat and to turn down the heat.

Conversely, if the sizzle is very slight, or you don’t hear it at all, that is a signal to turn up the heat.  As you become more confident, you will be able to maintain a constant sauté temperature without thinking about it.

Mistake #9  Trying to sauté big items

Cooking methods are not meant to be universally applied.  As a case in point, try to sauté a roast to doneness.  What will happen is that the outside of the meat will be hopelessly burned well before the center of the meat reaches the target temperature.

This is because a sauté is a high heat cooking method, and no amount of temperature manipulation will let you keep a true sauté temperature and allow you cook larger cuts long enough without burning the outsides.

The Fix—Sauté Smaller Cuts

If you want to cut “whole” pieces of meat, such as a chicken breast or a lamb chop, make sure that the meat is no more than ½” thick.  This holds true for beef as well.  You can pound a piece of meat with a smooth meat mallet to make sure that it is thin enough to cook all the way through without burning.

Cutting larger cuts up into ¾” chunks is an option, especially for stir-fry type dishes.

A mixture of carrots, onion and celery is sautéed as the first step in many dishes.  When sautéing vegetables, make sure that you have chopped them in small pieces or even diced them in no more than ¼” cubes.

Especially when sautéing is the only cooking method you are going to use, cutting the food in small pieces decreases the distance that the heat from the pan has to travel to get to the center of the food.  Keeping that distance as short as possible is the key to achieving a good sauté, ensuring that the center is done well before there are any issues with the outside getting over-done.

Mistake #10 Using the wrong cuts of meat

Since a sauté is a dry heat/ high heat cooking method, it stands to reason that the food you sauté will lose some moisture.

This is fine, if you are cooking thin lean meats, but if you try to sauté meats that contain a lot of connective tissue—ones best cooked by moist-heat cooking methods—you will end up with very dry meat that is very difficult to chew.

The Fix—Know Your Cuts

Chicken breasts, especially small or pounded ones, sauté beautifully.  Other likely candidates include fish fillets, thin-cut beef or pork tenderloin and pork or lamb chops.

These leaner cuts benefit from quick cooking.  At the same time, flavor develops when the meat is browned during the sauté process.

When sautéing, it is important to remember to place the side that you want to be “up” on the plate—the presentation side—to go into the pan first.  This is when the pan is the hottest, and you will get the best color.

(Cooking the presentation side first has nothing to do with flavor and everything to do with how the food looks once it is on the plate).

While this decision is not vital when sautéing a piece of tenderloin, it is important with items like chicken breasts and fish fillets.  In these cases, put the side of the meat that was closest to the skin in the pan first.  The other side is generally the cut side, where it was filleted from the bone, and it does not look as attractive.

Mistake #11  Overcrowding the Pan

As cooks with families, we often feel rushed to cook quickly, so the sauté is perfect for a fast meal.  Trying to sauté too much food at once to hurry things along, however, will result in not achieving a good sear and in the food actually taking longer to cook.

The Fix—Give the Food Some Space

When cooking small pieces of food, such as diced vegetables, you want to have the food in one layer in the pan.  This allows steam (created from the moisture in the food) to evaporate quickly and allow the food to cook above 212°F.

Remember, water boils at 212°F and as long as there is any water in the pan, the temperature will stay at 212°F until it has all cooked away.  Only then will the temperature of the food rise enough to brown.

When cooking chicken breast, if you have a small pan, only cook one at a time.  Again, you want any water in or on the surface of the food to evaporate quickly to encourage rapid browning and cooking.

You may have noticed that when you brown stew meat, if you add too much to the pan, a lot of liquid gathers in the pan and the meat essentially steams rather than browns.  This does nothing to help you develop flavors, as those wonderful caramel flavors do not begin developing until the food has reached about 330 degrees, F.

Mistake #12  Turning Too Soon or Too Late

When you place a piece of meat in a pan to sauté, you really can’t see what is going on to the side of the meat that is touching the pan.  All you are left looking at is what looks like a piece of raw meat in a pan.

So, you lift up the corners of the meat to take a look.  You turn it, sometimes tearing some of the meat that might be stuck in the pan, and you just flip it around from side to side until it “looks done” to you.

What you’re left with is a piece of meat that, while maybe cooked, will have an inadequate sear and might be kind of torn up.  Not good.

The Fix—Pay Attention to the Meat

Even though you can’t see what is going on with the “down side” of the meat, you can get a good idea by looking at the “up side.”  When you first place the meat in the pan, you’ll hear that satisfying sizzle.

After a minute or so, you will see the very outside edges of the cut begin to turn from translucent to opaque.  This is a sign that the proteins are cooking.  Don’t touch it; just leave it alone.

Now, there is a lot of moisture in meat, and eventually, you will start to see little beads of moisture welling up on the top of the meat.  This is a sign that the moisture is literally running away from the intense heat in the bottom of the pan.  Now, watch closely.

What you will see is the “ring” of opaque meat advancing up the edges of the “up side” of your meat.  Once your thin piece of meat appears to be cooked about about 2/3 of the way through, it is now safe to turn.

If you haven’t been messing with your meat all along, you will see that it releases quite easily from the pan.  This is because, once the food has browned, it will naturally release.

This is one of the main keys to stress free sautéing.  Once you learn that the meat will tell you when it’s ready to move, you realize that it is monitoring itself, so you can make sure you are monitoring the temperature.

Cook the meat on the second side for a minute or two.  At this point, the best way to check for doneness is to insert an instant read thermometer into the meat.

Since the cuts are fairly thin, you will only need to allow for no more than 5°F in carry over cooking.  For example, if your chicken breast is done at 160 degrees, you can take it off the heat at 156-158°F and the temperature will coast the rest of the way while the meat is resting.

Mistake #13  Serving Without a Sauce

Since a sauté is a dry heat cooking method best done with lean cuts, chances are that, while the meat will be flavorful because of the browning, it might be a little dry due to evaporation.  The meat will be tasty, but take a look at the pan your sautéed in.

You’ll see some golden-to-dark brown bits of food in there.  That is called “fond,” and it is full of flavor that you should exploit to make a great pan sauce.

The Fix—The Quick Pan Sauce

Now, I know that you’ve saved a lot of time by making a quick sauté, so I’m not going to suggest that you make a sauce that will take an hour to prepare.  No, you can make a quick pan sauce while your meat is resting.

Let’s say there are four of you eating, so you’ve cooked 3 chicken breast, one of which you’ll split between your kids.  Each piece of meat really only needs one or two tablespoons of good sauce, so you are looking at a total of 4 Tablespoons, or ¼ cup.  This won’t take long at all, especially over high heat.

Put your sauté pan back over high heat.  Let it heat for a minute or so, but keep an eye on it.  You don’t want your fond to burn.

Add ¼ cup each of orange juice and low sodium chicken broth.  Cook and scrape the bottom of the pan, incorporating the fond into the sauce.

Reduce by ½, until the sauce is thick and syrupy.  Taste, and add a little salt, pepper or herbs.

Remove the sauce from the heat, and swirl in about 1 teaspoon of butter or just a tiny splash of heavy cream.  Either of these additions will add a touch of richness and a nice mouth feel to the sauce, but you can also leave that out.

Serve a spoonful of sauce on each piece of chicken.

Now, this is only one idea, and I’m sure you can come up with many more.  The procedure will always be the same for these quick pan sauces.

How Much Heat To Use When Sauteing
G. Stephen Jones • September 16, 2012 • 8 Comments

How Much Heat Should I Use When Sauteing?

I recently received an email from a reader asking about the type of heat to use when sauteing. They wanted to know if I use medium, medium-high, or high heat.  They also wanted to know about the heat of the pan and the fat you cook with.

Great questions so I wanted to share my response with you. Be sure to read my post How To Saute.  It will give you a better idea of the whole process of sauteing so this will make more sense to you.

Factors To Consider

How hot you get your pan before you add your oil or butter and start cooking depends on several factors:

What type of pan you are using.

What type of fat you are sauteing with.

What you are cooking.

Your cooking experience level

The Hands Over Pan Technique

You may have seen in cooking magazines or cooking shows where the chef holds his hand over a hot pan and when they can no longer take the heat, the pan is ready. I find this technique amusing because I know I can hold my hand over the heat longer than my wife and my brother, who works with his hands can keep his hands over the pan a lot longer than I can. It may give you an idea but there is an easier way to tell when the pan is hot enough to add your fat.


Report this ad
 
Water simmers at 185°F but turns into steam at 212°F. so the best way I know of to tell if the pan is hot enough to add your fat is to sprinkle a few drops of water onto the hot pan. If the water evaporates immediately, you know the pan must be at least 212° F and a good starting point to add the fat.

It’s a great visual clue and safer than seeing how much heat the palm of your hand can take. Another way you can tell the temperature of the pan is using a infrared thermometers but I doubt many of you have one of those in your kitchen drawer.

Once you get your pan hot and add the cooking fat to it, the next question is how hot do you want the fat to be before adding ingredients. Just because the pan is hot doesn’t mean the fat (butter or oil) is ready for cooking. If you add cold butter to the pan, it can actually lower the temperature and may take longer to heat up to the proper temperature.

How to Properly Heat a Fry or Saute Pan Video

Check out my short cooking video at the top of the page describing a great way to determine how hot the pan should be before adding your fat to it using a simple water test. It will make a huge difference when you pan-fry or saute ingredients so they don’t stick to the pan.

The Ideal Temperature

There really is no ideal temperature. It really depends on what you are sautéing and what you plan to do with the ingredients when you are done. Most of the time I want to sear a piece of meat, chicken or fish and begin the caramelization process (actually the Maillard Reaction) to get that wonderful brown crust but that may not always be the case. Chef Todd Mohr told me:

Caramelization of sugars may not always be the goal, so the pan needn’t be 320°F all the time. That’s just my target zone to get a nice brown color on a protein product for plate presentation. Caramelization may not be the goal if you’re going to use the chicken in another preparation where color or texture isn’t important.

Let’s say you’re making chicken burritos. A caramel “crust” on a chicken breast that is going to be shredded, wrapped in a tortilla with sauce, and baked again, may not be the best method. Then, 320°F isn’t the goal. However, you certainly always want to make sure the pan is above 165F, where proteins coagulate and cooking begins.

Caramelizing and the Maillard Reaction

I am not a food scientist so I will not try to get too scientific explaining this but from what I’ve read, home cooks often confuse Caramelization with the Maillard Reaction, a process called the Maillard Reaction, named for the chemist who first studied these reactions in 1912.

The Maillard reactions, of which there are many, are a series of browning reactions that occur when certain sugars react with the amino acids found in proteins. These reactions are accelerated by heat and also the pH of the food being cooked.

Caramelization is the process where sugars react with sugars in the presence of high heat but without the proteins. I suppose if you are sauteing just vegetables, it would be called caramelizing.

That’s as scientific as I’m going to get but I’m sure there are many great sources out there if you want to learn more about these processes. Whether you call it the Maillard Reaction or Caramelizing, this process is what gives you that wonderful brown and flavorful crust that we are looking for when we saute.

So How Do We Know When The Fat Is Hot Enough?

As mentioned above, we want to start when the fat in the pan is approximately around 320° F which in most cases is just below the smoking point for butter, lard and the various cooking oils. You never want to actually reach the smoking point because at this point the fat is ruined and will add a bad taste to whatever you are cooking.

So the question is how do we know we are approaching the smoking point of the fat we are using and not hit it?

For butter, I suggest when the butter stops foaming and begins to turn a pale brown, it is ready to start sauteing. With oil, you will know it is hot enough when it goes from perfectly smooth to shimmering or forms striations (lines) in the pan. Chef Todd explained to me:

In saute, you heat the oil until “just before it begins to smoke”. Oil will begin a convection process before smoking, going from perfectly smooth in the pan to striated, getting ripples.

Sesame oil will smoke immediately in a 320°F pan. Peanut oil can handle it. So, I heat the pan to around 212°F before adding the oil. This should give you plenty of time before reaching the oil’s smoking point and now you’re cooking with your eyes watching for those striations.

As always, be careful when heating oils or any fats over a hot stove or in a hot pan. Be ready for any possible flame ups that can occur.

Smoking Points

Have you ever added oil or butter to a pan, put the pan on the flame and got involved in something else only to turn around and see the pan smoking? What do you do? Take the pan off the heat and use it anyway? Not a good idea.

The smoking point of fat is the temperature where the heated fat begins to breakdown, degrade and start smoking. At this point the fat is shot and you need to wipe the pan clean with a paper towel and start all over again. If you don’t, the degraded fat transfers its unappealing taste to whatever you are cooking.

WARNING: Hot oil is very dangerous and can burn you. Most home cooks rarely get their pans and the fats they cook with to the proper temperature so if you do start heating your pans and fats to optimum levels, be very careful not to burn yourself. You may even want to start at slightly lower levels than discussed here until you are comfortable before taking them a little higher.

Practice Makes Perfect

I’m predicting the first time a home cook tries cooking at the proper pan and fat temperatures they are going to burn whatever it is they are cooking. I suggest you start off by practicing with a diced onion in a small saute or fry pan and get a little experience before attempting anything more.

Get the pan hot enough to evaporate some drops of water, watch as the oil begins shimmering in the pan and notice what it you see when you add the diced onion to the pan.

You have to be on your game when cooking like a professional. You can’t be working on ten different things. Staying focused is critical for great outcomes and for your own safety. Learning how to saute properly, degaze a pan and making reduction sauces on high heat takes practice and a lot of it. So again, be careful.

Just like your chopping skills that take time to develop and get better, sautéing skills are the same. Most home cooks don’t sauté 100 meals a night, six nights a week like a professional cook so they don’t have the skills to work at the highest heat. For us mere mortals, it’s best to start off using medium to medium-high heat until you build up your speed.

With some dishes where there is a lot of liquid to reduce, it’s fine to crank up the heat to high, but as you get close to finishing the dish or when the sauce is at the right consistency, you may want to turn the heat down a little so it doesn’t get away from you. And by all means, don’t walk away from the stove.

There have been times when I am finishing a pan sauce and something else that needs to be done distracts me and the sauce reduces too much. If this happens, you can try to save it by adding a little more stock but it will turn out better if you stay with the sauce from start to finish.

If you must walk away, (like when one of the kids need immediate attention) just remove the pan from the stove-top and finish it later.

The other factor is the sauté pan. If you are using a well-made, heavy bottomed sauté pan, there is more room for error. That’s because when the pan is doing it job properly, it disperses the heat evenly throughout the bottom and sides and the heavy bottom will prevent burning. With less expensive pans that are thin and made of inferior materials, hot spots develop that cause one part of the reduction to heat faster than another resulting in uneven cooking and burning.

A good example of how to sauté quickly is Chef Ricco’s Garlic and Oil.

The Secret To Great Saute

How to Saute

How to Saute Like a Professional Chef

Probably the most important technique I can share with you is how to sauté properly. When you learn how to saute, you can prepare hundreds of meals with this technique.

What Is Saute?

Saute in French means “to jump” and can be a method of cooking or a way to describe a dish like sauteed chicken breasts. The reason the French called this technique “to jump” is because you are cooking at a very high heat and you don’t want it sitting too long in the pan.

To be successful, you need to move the ingredients either with a pair of tongs or like they do on TV by tossing it in the air.

Saute is a type of frying which is a dry heat method of cooking requiring high heat and some sort of liquid fat to cook with.

What Is the Difference Between Sauteing & Pan Frying?

Although they are both considered dry heat cooking and use a fat to transfer the heat of the pan to the food, the only real differences is the amount of heat and the size of the ingredient you are cooking.

Pan frying uses a little less heat and you cook whole pieces of meat like chicken breasts, steaks or fish fillets. You also don’t move the ingredients around in the pan that much except to turn them over occasionally.

Also, don’t confuse pan fry with shallow fry where you typically use enough oil to reach almost halfway up the ingredient you are cooking. A good example is when you pan-fry eggplant for eggplant Parmesan.

The Advantages of Sauteing

Once learned and in your repertoire, you will be free to be creative and devise your own recipes with whatever ingredients you have around. As a novice, this technique is easy and allows you to prepare meals in a moment’s notice.

This includes sautéing chicken, fish, vegetables, or meat. That’s the beauty of learning a basic technique. Compare it to learning how to read a financial statement. Once you know how, you can effectively read any company’s report. sautéing

 

The Formula To A Great Saute

Proper Saute = Good Saute Pan + High Heat + A Little Fat + Uniformly Cut Ingredients

 

The Right Pan For The Job

Some say the pan the pan should have sloped sides, others say straight. To me it doesn’t matter as long as the pan has a dense, heavy bottom that spreads the heat evenly without any hot spots. It has to be big enough to cook your ingredients without crowding so buy accordingly.

Non-stick is ok if you don’t plan to make pan sauces but you need a little sticking to create the “fond” or the brown bits that stick to your pan that are responsible for those delicious sauces served in your favorite restaurants. I use a non-stick pan for my sauteed spinach and broccoli rabe but prefer metal for everything else.

To learn more about what to look for in a good saute pan and how to purchase the best one for you, check out my Choosing A Good Saute Pan.

The Right Fat – Butter or Oil or Both?

It all has to do with smoking points. Butter (350°F) will give your food the best taste and a wonderful golden crust but burns more easily. Oil (375° F – 450° F) produces a nice crust and will not burn as quickly, but also doesn’t leave as rich a flavor or color as butter alone. Most chefs will use different oils depending on what they are cooking.

If they are cooking a Mediterranean style dish, they may choose olive oil, but if they are preparing an Asian dish, sesame oil might be the better choice. You match the oil to the style of cooking but remember much of the flavor will be cooked off because of the high heat so you may just be better off using a generic oil like canola or safflower and add a little of the flavored oil at the end.

The Reluctant Gourmet uses a combination of the two. This way I get some of the flavor from the butter and a higher smoking point from the oil. What you cook and the amount you’re cooking will determine how butter and oil you use.

For example, use about 1 to 1-1/2 tablespoons of each for 2 or more chicken cutlets and 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of each for 2 or more fish fillets.

How Much Fat?

Just enough to coat the bottom of the pan. You are not deep frying so just cover the bottom of the pan. When a recipe tells you to add 2 tablespoons of oil to the pan, how do they know what size pan you are using. If you add 2 tablespoons to a small pan, it may be too much. 2 tablespoons in a large pan might not be big enough. So add accordingly.

Important Tip – Preheating the Pan

The biggest mistake home cooks make when sauteing is not getting the pan hot enough. They take cold ingredients right out of the refrigerator, put them into a cold pan and stick it on the flame. Big mistake – don’t do it. You’ll end with bone dry meat, chicken or fish.

Have you ever asked yourself why your cookbooks and cooking magazines suggest you preheat a pan before adding butter or oil to it? I did and spent a lot of time looking for the answer until I contacted my friends Chef Todd Mohr and Chef Ricco DeLuca. They had several reasons for preheating your pans:

Chef Todd Mohr

If you add cold protein ingredients to a cold pan and put it on the heat, the ingredients will release some of their moisture as it heats up and you end up with dry meats and fish.

It’s hard to watch a home cook put that cold white piece of chicken in a saute pan, slowly releasing it’s moisture, gently simmering in it’s own fat, rather than searing at high heat.

Chef Ricco DeLuca

All pans have hot spots. These are places on a pan that heat up faster than the rest of the pan. If you add butter or oil to a cold pan and then heat it up, it can hit one of these hot spots and start burning.

If you start with a hot pan that is uniformly heated, there is less chance for the fat to hit a hot spot and burn. When sauteing, you want the butter to foam up before you start and the oil to “almost” start smoking.

If it starts smoking, you are too late and the oil will leave a bad flavor to your dish. You want the oil hot but not smoking. Now you are ready to start the saute.

There is an expression, “A watched pot never boils” which means if you stand there and watch a pot of water come to boil, it seems like it is taking forever. Our attention drifts and we get distracted.

The same is true when heating up butter and oil in a pan. Have you ever added some cold butter to a cold pan, pushed it around a bit, became distracted and walked away only to have the butter burn?

By preheating the pan you are ready to start cooking the moment you add your fat. Your attention is focused.

Why Not Just Pre-Heat The Fat With The Pan

You might think it would save time just to heat the fat in the pan at the same time but this is not a good idea. As fats heat up, they start to degrade once they reach 140° F. So rather than let the fat continuously breakdown from 140°F to your ideal temperature, it’s better to add the oil to an already hot pan.

How Much Heat Should You Use When Sauteing?

This is an import question and one I’m asked a lot so I wrote a short article describing How Hot Should You Heat Your Pan When Sauteing?

How to Pre-Heat a Saute Pan?

I suggest you put the pan on medium high heat and when the pan is hot enough to evaporate a few drops of water, you know it has to be at least 212° F. This is a good starting point to add your fat. If you have the heat too high, you risk the chance of burning the fat. Too low and the fat won’t be hot enough.

Remember though, once your pan is preheated, you are ready to cook and and when you add your butter and/or oil, you may have crank up your heat a little before you start to sauté. The butter or oil will actually bring down the pan temperature.

Interesting Point About Heating A Pan

If you put it on low heat, won’t the pan keep getting hotter and hotter? That’s what I use to think but the answer is no. The pan will only get as hot as the amount of heat (Btu’s) you apply to it. If you preheated a pan on low, it would get to a maximum temperature and that’s it. To get more heat you have to add more Btu’s or in the case of a gas stove, more flame.

Equal Sized Ingredients

Whether it is chopped up vegetables to be used as aromatics to add flavor to the dish, breasts of chicken, fillets of fish or steak medallions, you want them all to be the same size so they cook evenly. You especially want the aromatics to be finely chopped or minced so they give off more flavor more quickly.

If the ingredients are all cut at different sizes, some will cook faster and overcook and some will cook slower and under cook. Culinary students learn right away how to make precision cuts by spending hours cutting up vegetables for different dishes.

Basic Technique

If you are using butter, you will know your pan is hot enough and it is time to start when the butter stops foaming and begins to turn a pale brown. If you are using just oil, you will know it is hot enough when it goes from perfectly smooth to lined or shimmering. Be careful, let it go any further and it will start to smoke and you will need to start over.

The photo on the left show canola oil added to a hot pan that is at least 212° F. I raised the heat under the pan and a few minutes later you can see the oil in the pan on the right begin to shimmer. This is just below the smoking point (435° F) and time to saute. For the record, I added some diced onions and a couple of them literally “jumped” out of the pan.

Add your ingredients but be very careful not to let it start smoking. If it does, remove the pan from the heat for a moment. You may want to turn the heat down a little but as soon as you add the ingredients, it should lower the heat in the pan. Cooking time will vary, depending on what you are cooking.

Most recipes give you times for cooking each ingredient but I suggest you use these only as estimates because there is no way they can give you an exact time without knowing size & type of pan you are using, the Btu’s of your stove top, the thickness of the fish, chicken or meat you are cooking or your level of cooking expertise.

The times should be used as guidelines but in the end you need to depend on an internal thermometer in the beginning and experience after that.

Also, never use a fork for flipping, it pierces the meat and lets the juices escape. Depending on what you are cooking, you will want to let whatever you are cooking rest for the juices to redistribute. This give you time to make a delicious pan sauce.

How to make Mutton Kashmiri Korma

Step 1    Firstly, peel the onions and thinly slice them. On the other hand soak the almonds in water for about an hour. Now, put a kadhai on medium flame and a two tablespoon refined oil in it. Add the sliced onions in it and fry till golden brown in colour. Soak the extra oil and keep it aside in a bowl to cool down.
Step 2    In a blender, add these golden-fried onions, yoghurt, soaked almonds along with green cardamom and blend well to make a thick creamy paste.
Step 3    Transfer this onion and yoghurt paste in a bowl and keep aside. Now spray a little water inside the blender and keep aside this washed out water for further use.
Step 4    Finally put a pressure cooker on medium flame and add refined oil in it. Let the oil heat well then add star anise (badiya) cloves, black cardamom and whole black pepper in it. Temper them until fragrant.
Step 5    Next, add ginger and garlic paste in the whole spices and saute for a few seconds. Add mutton in the pressure cooker after sauteing the ginger-garlic paste. Then add salt as per your taste and stir for while.
Step 6    Stir the mutton so that the masala mixes well with it for about a minute. Then add the washed out water used in Step 3. Stir for a few seconds.
Step 7    Next, add coriander powder, red chilli powder along with garam masala in the mutton. (Optional: If possible, use homemade garam masala, it will enhance the flavours of the dish.)
Step 8    Stir till the masala is cooked completely, and add 3/4 glass of water in the cooker. Mix all the ingredients well.
Step 9    Close the lid of the pressure cooker and let the mutton cook for about 8-10 minutes or the cooker blows 8 whistles. Switch off the flame after the mutton is cooked and let the pressure cooker cool down. (Note: Dont open the pressure cooker by releasing the pressure forcefully.)
Step 10   When the pressure cooker is cooled down, remove the vent and open the lid of the pressure cooker.
Step 11   Check the mutton, whether it has become tender or not. If the mutton is tender, add the almond and yoghurt paste in it, and if not, close the lid again and cook the mutton once again for another 2-3 minutes.
Step 12   After mixing the paste in the mutton, adjust the consistency and cook for another minute by cooking for one more whistle. After a whistle, turn off the burner and let the cooker cool itself. After cooling down, remove the vent and open the lid.
Step 13   Your Kashmiri korma is ready, garnish with finely sliced almonds and serve immediately. Enjoy this korma this steamed rice or butter naan, as you like.
